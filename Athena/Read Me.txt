Hello! Thanks for buying Athena.

Before you start using, it's good to go over some of the rules. (Or you could just use it normally and avoid reading these)

1. Don't chargeback. Will result in a blacklist.
2. Don't share your key. Will result in all keys belonging to the purchaser being blacklisted, along with blacklisting the IP from using Athena.
3. Don't share the download. I don't really hold this one to as high standards, but it's just easier for me if you don't share the download.
4. Don't re-sell/giveaway your key unless given permission by me or other staff member.
5. Don't use Athena to advertise malware (rats, worms, adware, ect). If I find your whitelist ima just hit it with that "no u" ;)
6. Don't attempt to reverse engineer/crack Athena in any way. Will result in instant blacklist.
7. I can change these TOS at any time without prior notice. (Though I will usually give a heads up 3-4 days before)

ok ya enjoy
